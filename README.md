Decision Tree Classifier â€“ Purchase Prediction

This is a small machine learning project where I used a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a person will make a purchase based on features from a simple dataset.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle

What the project does:
-Loads and processes the dataset using pandas
-Trains a decision tree classifier from scikit-learn
-Evaluates accuracy on test data
-Visualizes the decision tree
-Libraries used:

--numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib--

What I learned:
-Handling categorical values in data
-Training and evaluating decision tree models
-Visualizing how the decision tree makes decisions

This is mainly a practice project to improve my understanding of machine learning.
